# Twitter Mock

This is a personalized Twitter-style feed built from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. While the project idea and image assets were inspired by Scrimba’s Frontend Developer Career Path, the entire UI and codebase were developed independently.

> 💡 No AI was used in the development of this project. AI tools were used only for documentation purposes, like generating this README. I believe having a strong foundation in programming is crucial, and using AI responsibly as a tool is part of being an effective modern developer.

## ✨ Overview

Live Demo: [https://beautiful-cuchufli-b9562b.netlify.app](https://beautiful-cuchufli-b9562b.netlify.app)

The project features a simple, mobile-first design that mimics a Twitter feed. It displays user tweets, profile images, and icons in a familiar layout to practice UI building and responsive design.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The app uses a static array of tweet data (in JS) to populate the feed.
- Each tweet includes user info, message text, and like/retweet icons.
- JavaScript dynamically inserts each tweet into the DOM based on the data.
- The layout is built using Flexbox, optimized for mobile viewing.

## 🛠️ Personalization

Although the original prompt came from Scrimba, the following aspects were fully custom:

- Hand-coded structure and styling
- Custom layout and alignment using flexbox
- Built with responsiveness in mind (currently optimized for mobile)

## 🚧 Planned Updates

- Expand design for desktop view
- Improve responsiveness across various screen sizes
- Refactor code for cleaner organization

## 🗂️ File Structure (basic)

- `index.html` – structure of the feed
- `style.css` – styles and layout
- `index.js` – handles interactivity (if expanded in future)

## ⚙️ Getting Started
